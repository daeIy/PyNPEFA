# PyNPEFA
 Generate an integrated prediction error filter analysis (INPEFA) curve based on given data. This program uses the l1 trend filtering algorithm before making the prediction error filter, and implements CVXOPT, Spectrum, lasio, and SciPy package. Check requirements.txt to install the required packages.
 
 Well log LAS file example is obtained from http://www.kgs.ku.edu/WellLogs/kcc_logs_2019/1051308423.zip
 
 PyNPEFA implementation example can be seen in ./example.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)
